1,2,1,"Right, staying offline prevents a lot of problems. How about being on an intranet with other devices that do connect to the internet? For example, how much more vulnerable is an IoT system if it has a raspberry pi as part of its internal network, which in turn is connecting to an internet connected smart phone via bluetooth?",Feb 3 at 3:58
1,2,2,"@cr0, ""device hopping"" is a real concern.  But consider, the bad actor would have to get through internet, bluetooth, and then exploit the RPi and finally exploit the IoT device.  This isn't any different than issues faced by non-IoT intranet devices.",Feb 5 at 19:48

2,1,7,"@Flummox Why do you think I started out my comment the way I did, including the formatting? I agree with this answer, and there's no way I'd buy one myself (for this and for other reasons as well), but if and only if someone has a genuine need for something like this, then there still are steps that can be taken to mitigate the risks a little bit. In such a situation, not at least doing that would be the height of irresponsibility, both toward yourself, others in your household, and others on the Internet.",Nov 2 '17 at 8:26
2,2,7,"Also, keeping in mind the distinction about what a remote attacker is trying to access. Assuming you aren't a high-profile target (and if you are, you probably know better than to trust random strangers on the Internet for security advice), it's fairly unlikely that a remote attacker who gains access to an IoT device (even one that can remotely be turned into an active microphone and speaker, or camera, in your home) is particularly interested in you specifically. It's all the more likely that they are interested in the device itself, e.g. for its computational power or network connectivity.",Oct 31 '17 at 20:16
2,2,7,"In response to your edit, in fairness, I wasn't necessarily thinking of using the device as an attack bot, though that's an obvious thing that could happen (think Mirai and the DNS overload attack against Twitter and friends recently, for one). Think also e.g. bitcoin mining, or sending spam e-mails. Sure, a toy like the one exemplified in the question probably doesn't have enough computational power to make a major difference, but if the cost to the attacker is next to zero, it doesn't need to do much in order to turn a profit, especially if you've got thousands of them working for you...",Oct 31 '17 at 20:21
2,2,10,"There was a recent documentary (BBC if memory serves me correctly) showing the story of an elderly woman who answered the phone to a scammer and was convinced to transfer them a large sum of money. Key to the scam was their use of the camera and microphone on her laptop during the call. If such a device as this ""toy"" is easier to break into than a (presumably) windows machine, then this becomes just one example where an exploit of this type increases the risk surface area",Nov 2 '17 at 4:47

3,2,21,"@wizzwizz4 I doubt that the lack of a bug bounty program would ever be the confounding factor in a breach. Bounties are great, but they're an optional layer in almost any business' defence budget, perhaps with the exception of highly public organisations. If the goal is to avoid a breach, the cost and time involved with running a BBP can be better invested in more direct defence measures such as staff training and improving blue team capabilities.

There may be plenty of reasons to keep software proprietary that have nothing to do with security (contracts with customers, red tape by management, valuable algorithms).

6,1,43,Note that with IPv6 the devices would be accessible by default without even needing UPnP nor opening ports (most consumer-grade routers don't firewall IPv6 from what I've seen).,Oct 25 '16 at 3:58
6,1,44,@AndréBorie It is probably not a good idea for routers to have no firewall by default. I think a large number of consumers have a (possibly unjustified) expectation that the router will protect all the insecure devices on the LAN. And I think those who really don't need the firewall will know how to access the configuration and change the firewall setting.,Oct 25 '16 at 7:22
6,1,45,"@AndréBorie On some level, that expectation is a hangover from IPv4 and NAT, where two devices couldn't communicate unless ports are explicitly opened on routers.

6,2,46,"@tlng05, don't confuse NAT, a kludge to extend IPv4 addressing, with firewalls. You can have a very secure firewall that doesn't have NAT enabled, and you can NAT on a device without having a firewall.

6,2,46,"@RenéG, a firewall protects your network, not NAT. If you have no firewall features, it is possible to take over the router by its public address, Then NAT does nothing for you because the router knows how to get to the internal network. Also, if a different port is open, it is possible under some circumstances to get through NAT to take over an inside host, then all bets are off. NAT doesn't really provide security, firewalls do.",Dec 4 '16 at 22:53
6,3,52,"Its accesible from the wider Internet, there you are correct. I won't say that is wide open. I think for over 20 years the basic routers are closed on the common ports. You cannot connect over port 22 to each ip-adres of something like that. But as stated above. UPnP removes this security big time. Never enable that, that makes your router insecure",Oct 25 '16 at 9:35
6,3,30,"@AdamSitemap The only security UPnP removes is accidental security. If a port is filtered by a firewall, enabling UPnP won't unfilter it. If a port is not filtered by a firewall, any security is accidental and unreliable.",Oct 25 '16 at 18:45
6,4,54,"I think this adds a valuable point: my understanding is that a lot of these crappy IoT devices that have been compromised have actually been placed outside any firewall perimeter a user might have, directly connected to the Internet.

It is directly connecting to the end-users' webcams and other IoT devices by connecting to well-known ports that the devices have exposed using UPnP, then testing a set of 66 different default credentials on those ports.

The heading is: ""Does the local network need to be hacked first for IoT devices to be accesible?"" Based on that heading, the answer is no, the attacker doesn't even always have to make any effort to breach your router at all. If they can get away with social engineering the IoT device vendor's company, they can get into all of the devices at once since, often, all those devices already made outgoing persistent connections to the IoT vendor.

6,8,60,"Yes, in the sense that these IoT devices can be used to perform the DDoS reflection attack on an unsuspecting 3rd party. There are other significant security issues with many IoT devices simply because manufacturers have not designed security into their systems. However, using them to perform DDoS reflection attacks is one of the highest concerns as it provides the potential to impact on large numbers of unsuspecting victims. The other security issues associated with IoT tend to only affect the individual/site running them,so less potential impact.",Jan 24 '17 at 9:33
6,8,48,"@TimX, you said ""In many cases, the devices have not been hacked at all - they are performing as designed."" Except an IoT network is generally kept behind a firewall, where network security has to be penetrated first.  Sure, you could possibly send my IoT devices into an amplification attack against each other that would make my house unhappy, but my traffic won't impact your house. That would require my devices to violate your firewall to get your devices to attack each other. Propagating the attack takes hacking the devices. Mirai hacked the devices, they were not ""performing as designed"".",Feb 7 '17 at 15:26
6,8,60,"One small problem with your assumption about firewalls - IPv6. Vary few of the modems sold in the domestic market support firewalls for IPv6, yet the majority of them now support IPv6 and an increasing number of ISPs now enable IPv6 by default.  The other problem is that many of these IoT devices are designed to allow external connections - either requiring port forwarding or using something awful like uPnP. Combine this with the high use of IoT in domestic and small office situations where IT skills are often low and you have a problem. Relying on the firewall is really just 'candy' security",Feb 8 '17 at 18:34
6,10,48,"Hi @Culme, the issue here is that the devices are visible to the internet, where economies of scale mean that dozens of hacked devices can be set upon thousands of other devices, which can then hack millions.  An insecure 433MHz RF connection can be exploited only by an attacker physically located within signal range of your house. And hacking your single IoT device doesn't grant him the ability to hack thousands of other RF devices, unless he drives to a thousand other homes.

7,2,69,"With a properly done attack, Tor could be rather productive.  You just need a magnification/reflection attack.  Take an old-school ICMP magnification: you send a few bytes over Tor to a vulnerable host claiming to be from the final target, they send a few hundred kB to the target.  You can use Tor to shotgun out to your amplifiers, which basically hides you behind 2 layers of obscurity from the target (vulnerable amplifiers, Tor, then you).  That also obscures Tor as being part of the attacker's vector (victim only sees packets from amplifiers who aren't greatly affected so don't report)",Apr 26 '17 at 13:03
7,2,69,"I might add, that is why good routers and firewalls are so picky about well formed ICMP packets, and why this isn't nearly as common an attack vector as it once was (also why I don't mind explaining it).  The first D in DDoS is for distributed, and while you got that from the attacker's perspective (multiple cloud instances to lay in the attack) you forgot that it isn't cost effective for an attacker to own the DDoS hosts, only the instigators.
