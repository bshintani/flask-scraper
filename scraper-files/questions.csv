1,Proper security for IoT device,"
I'm developing a product with simple Cortex-M MCU (with no OS on board, firmware on bare metal) and internet connectivity via external module.
How do I make it secure? More specifically, how do I protect the data that is sent to and from the remote server?
My thoughts are:

I can't assume that firmware can be protected; since all users will have physical access to it - they eventually will find a way to dump it. Flash-read protection won't work, encrypting the flash won't prevent dumping it from RAM or something else.  
Using external encrypted flash/eeprom won't work for the same reasons.  
Relying on HTTPS on the external chip won't be enough because external module is connected to the MCU via UART and can easily be sniffed or tampered.

I have very basic understanding of cryptography but I know that I shouldn't invent my own, so I presume I'll have to encrypt all the data that is sent to the server by some well-known public key crypto. Probably using session keys.
But that still requires using one master secret key on the device and I don't know how to store it securely due to 1).
Any ideas? Is there a well-known bulletproof solution?
Or I should just generate random keys for every device (not derived from device ID or anything like that)? So if one device is compromised it won't affect the whole network - and that's about it?
UPD: Clarification - I don't want to allow device owner to impersonate other devices and upload false data (about other devices) to the database.

2,Do I need Gateway Firewall for IoT network? [closed],"
Do I need a gateway firewall to prevent attacks like DoS, if my IoT network can only talk to cloud using IPsec?
Even if  there is need that can be implemented at cloud. Is there any need for it to present in IoT network?

3,What kind of IoT devices use certificates?,"
I have read that PKI certificates are the main way to provide security on IoT platforms. And the common enrollment protocols for certificates are:

SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) 
EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) 
CMP (Certificate Management Protocol) 
CMC (Certificate Management over CMS)

(CMP is the one which is used for securing LTE eNodeBs.) 

Now what is not clear is what devices get the certificates? I am assuming that sensors etc are too small to get certificates and use them? So is anything used for securing sensors in IoT? I think gateways can use certs but gateways probably don't need these protocols - they are not really IOT devices. Also what do the gateways use the certs for - is it to communicate with the cloud servers or is it to communicate with the gateways?  
So what kind of IoT devices use these protocols to enroll certs? How do they use the certs? Do they use it only for authentication? Or also for encrypting communication? Are they sophisticated enough to do this?

4,Which are the most dangerous and popular botnets that came from IoT devices?,"
The ease of taking control of a cheap IoT device makes them the perfect target to craft a botnet to perform DDoS attacks. 
I heard about botnets created from a lot of hacked IoT devices used to create DDoS attacks on websites.
How much of this information is true? Is there an existing common threat about IoT botnets nowadays? Which were the most popular IoT botnets and attacks?

5,Which are the most common vulnerabilities for poor crafted IoT devices? [closed],"
I'm learning about securing IoT devices and starting to learn how to develop my own software for them. 
I wanted to know which are the most common vulnerabilities that any scriptkiddie could exploit and how to be aware of them in general terms. 
I'm in a very initial stage, so any tip or information regarding:

Popular vulnerabilities in devices or brands
Securing typical sofware for cameras/sensors/small devices...
Tools for pentesting devices/examples

6,Is using both client side certificate and JWT for IoT device redundant?,"
Is there a case to be made for authorizing with both a client side certificate and JWT for an IoT device?
Are JWTs good enough (assuming following of the specs)?
And if client side certs are truly needed, what of expiration dates? (set the client cert expiration way out into the future, etc)?

7,How to keep Internet of Things projects secure? [closed],"
I want to experiment with the use of sensors for data logging and potentially for automated actions based on data properties. An example of the latter is if a value being monitored exceeds a threshold for X amount of intervals, some kind of notification or response is triggered, whether an LED lighting up or email being sent out.
I'm not an expert about sensors, networking, IoT, robotics, scripting, machine learning, or programming in general. That's all part of the learning process. I know enough to know security is important and easier to achieve if it's a goal from the beginning. So my question as I embark on this learning excursion is, what do I need to be aware of or control for to keep these systems safe as I create and experiment with them? If that question is so broad a book answers it, could you recommend a learning resource? Where does one start for learning how to keep home brewed IoT systems secure?
I realize this depends on two major things: security is harder as complexity increases; and security depends on threat models. Well, my simple sensor systems are bound to get more complex if I pursue more significant projects with them, thus the importance of good security that scales from the start. As for threat models, I don't anticipate enemies and these would all be relatively low-value and plentiful targets (many sensors monitoring basic things) but I do expect there are malicious agents seeking to control any processing power they can or disrupt systems just for the sake of chaos. Lastly as an importart part of the threat model is physical security, because if I put a sensor outside with a solar panel to power it, how do I stop mischievous kids or crooks from destroying or stealing the technology?

8,How safe are wifi enabled talking toys?,"
There have been ads on the radio recently for a wifi enabled toy called Talkies, which are advertised as being able to communicate with app enabled phones, with a ""trusted circle"" that other phones can be added to.
(Obligatory photo of a cute wifi enabled critter)

Especially considering the Krack vulnerability, and the known process of ""grooming"" a child that a sexual or other predator goes through to gain their trust and exploit them (Here is a story about how Snapchat was used), is this a toy that I should steer away from for my child?

9,how to implement TLS between web-server and embedded devices,"
I am working on remote light control system. The devices/controllers are like raspberry pi sized units running embedded programs to accept commands from a management application running on remote web-server. The devices are deployed in the field (street) and connected to internet via  GPRS & Ethernet.
There are hundreds of such devices not having host-name and their IP is not static. So SSL certificates may not be possible here???.  
Does the ""shared secrete"" approach works best here? but then distributing these keys to already existing devices would be challenging as it cannot be done over insecure OTA.

10,Secure operation of IoT equipment?,"
In the light of recent events around Mirai not being the only IoT botnet, but being joined by IoTroop / IoT_reaper (see here and here ), I wondered what steps need to be taken to securely operate an IoT device. Obviously, just plugging the device into your public-IP internet connection is unwise. But I don't feel that this is the usual deployment scenario. My personal setup is a rather typical home-user's: ISP -> cable modem -> wireless router, and all computers/devices behind this router. This means that there is some firewalling between any given device and the internet. As far as my experience from several companies and universities goes, there is a similar amount of firewalling, if you'd plug your IoT device into any of their company-in-house-network sockets.
So, the first part amounts to the question: What (network) attack vectors need to be considered?
In the above-mentioned setup I regarded the IoT-device as not directly accessible from the internet. This does not seem to be true in the presence of an UPnP-enabled router. On several sites I found that deactivating UPnP increases your security. By my mediocre understanding what UPnP does, this seems very logical, as I don't want insecure devices to poke holes into my firewall. But the same sites that suggest turning UPnP off, never seem to mention what possible side-effects this might have. (I read that some software like Windows Live Messenger relys on UPnP?)
Without UPnP, and without manually redirecting any ports to my IoT device, it seems that my IoT-device would need to make active connections. I can imagine two reasons to make such connections: Connecting to an automatic firmware upgrade mechanism, and to connect to a manufacturer/third-party service, which allows the device to be available from outside of my LAN (e.g. like the Ivideon service).
So, the second part of the question is: Do these active connections pose a threat? (Given that any accounts on such sites have decent passwords.) Does one need to be afraid of man-in-the-middle attacks on the FW-upgrade mechanism, or maliciously altered FW-images?
But what else am I missing out? 
[ Of course, there are two most-basic suggestions, one hears on a daily basis: Change default passwords and apply firmware updates (if the manufacturer even cares to provide them). ]

11,Managing https security for IoT gateways,"
My company is a IoT-Gateway manufacturer. Customers are increasingly getting serious about security issues in the IoT domain. Additionally, governments require dedicated security features as HTTPS for embedded web severs.
For example, the German government agency for security in IT-systems (BSI) requires to use ""TLS 1.2 in combination MIT Perfect Forward Secrecy"" as minimum security.
My questions are: 

From an IoT manufacturer's point of view, is an ""upload certificate"" feature in the IoT device sufficient to ensure certificate security?
Are there already a standard API (or RFC) to replace certificates? Considering large IoT installations the replacement and management of certificates is defitively a big challenge.
How do companies manage the HTTPS certificate infrastructure for IoT devices today? Are self-signed certificates used in Intranets or official certificates? Does every IoT gateway get a different certificate? Do companies operate private certificate authorities?

I'm working with Arduino and hash-based signatures which are signature schemes that use only hash functions. Due to the constraints of an Arduino I was thinking about using SHA1 as the underlying function of my hash-based signature. But I'm not sure if it still makes sense to use SHA1 due to its vulnerabilities. Is there a scenario in which would be acceptable to use SHA1?
