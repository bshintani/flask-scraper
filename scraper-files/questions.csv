1,How to keep Internet of Things projects secure? [closed],"
I want to experiment with the use of sensors for data logging and potentially for automated actions based on data properties. An example of the latter is if a value being monitored exceeds a threshold for X amount of intervals, some kind of notification or response is triggered, whether an LED lighting up or email being sent out.
I'm not an expert about sensors, networking, IoT, robotics, scripting, machine learning, or programming in general. That's all part of the learning process. I know enough to know security is important and easier to achieve if it's a goal from the beginning. So my question as I embark on this learning excursion is, what do I need to be aware of or control for to keep these systems safe as I create and experiment with them? If that question is so broad a book answers it, could you recommend a learning resource? Where does one start for learning how to keep home brewed IoT systems secure?
I realize this depends on two major things: security is harder as complexity increases; and security depends on threat models. Well, my simple sensor systems are bound to get more complex if I pursue more significant projects with them, thus the importance of good security that scales from the start. As for threat models, I don't anticipate enemies and these would all be relatively low-value and plentiful targets (many sensors monitoring basic things) but I do expect there are malicious agents seeking to control any processing power they can or disrupt systems just for the sake of chaos. Lastly as an importart part of the threat model is physical security, because if I put a sensor outside with a solar panel to power it, how do I stop mischievous kids or crooks from destroying or stealing the technology?

2,How safe are wifi enabled talking toys?,"
There have been ads on the radio recently for a wifi enabled toy called Talkies, which are advertised as being able to communicate with app enabled phones, with a ""trusted circle"" that other phones can be added to.
(Obligatory photo of a cute wifi enabled critter)

Especially considering the Krack vulnerability, and the known process of ""grooming"" a child that a sexual or other predator goes through to gain their trust and exploit them (Here is a story about how Snapchat was used), is this a toy that I should steer away from for my child?

4,Could IOT Botnets be Stopped by Static IP addressing the Devices?,"
I followed the recent IOT DDOS against Dyn and noticed that the attack seemed have three rounds of attack and mitigation. Since I'm not well versed in infosec I did some reasearch around DDOS mitigation techniques. From what I could tell it seems mitigation is essential heuristic traffic analysis to filter out humans from bots then IP banning.  Separately, I also noticed that in almost all the media had the same conclusion that IOT devices are insecure and can't/won't be patched for years. If these two assumptions are true, DDOS mitigation in its rawest since is IP filtering, and we are stuck with millions of infected IOT devices (and adding millions more devices that will one day likely be infected), wouldn't it make sense to start giving IOT devices a static IP, and then when it's detected as participating in a DDOS share the IP to others and block it?

5,How can I secure my security cameras?,"
I have dozens of cheap security cameras in my offices. I was under the assumption that, once I changed the admin password, disabled the insecure ""P2P Mode"", disabled UPNP, disabled guest access and changed default ports I was safe.
After the Mirai hack, I was shocked to see that my ""security"" camera it's accessible via telnet with root:xc3511.

Now, the telnet port shouldn't be forwarded outside by the router, but still it's a problem. What if some PC on the LAN gets infected by some malware?

6,Does the local network need to be hacked first for IoT devices to be accessible?,"
I completely understand how IoT devices were used in the massive DDoS attacks because they are easily manipulated due to lack of firewalls, default passwords, etc.
What I don't understand is although easily hacked, most IoT devices are connected to secured private wifi networks. 
Here's the question: So is it assumed that these thousands of IoT devices' networks were hacked first, then the device itself was hacked?

7,Cloud-based DDoS as a Service,"
With the consolidation of cloud computing and virtualization, a really simple doubt comes to my mind: why isn't DDoS being largely offered as a service? Why don't we see cloud-based DDoS attacks? 
vDOS, LizardStresser and others offered a way in which you could pay to attack a target but they used their own infrastructure. 
It seems safer and simpler to just charge a client, use part of that money to rent servers on an IaaS provider and build a cloud-based botnet. That way one could start an attack from inside the provider to a specific target without even using their own structure. This could even be used for spoofing of attacks in general. Is there any particular reason why this doesn't happen? 
I have no idea how difficult it is to build a botnet in either context (standard or cloud-based), if getting caught in the cloud would be easier or if this could just be a matter of profit.
Thanks in advance.

8,Can secrets be made safe in memory?,"
Say, I am running an application on a cloud server such as AWS. Suppose I supply a key at run-time (so its not stored anywhere alongside/inside code), is there a way to secure this key in memory?
So if an attacker gets access to the remote server at a later time, he still should not be able to extract the key from memory. Are there any ways to achieve this? Or is it known to be theoretically impossible?
The technique discussed here, transparent runtime security, is claimed to make it ""difficult"", but it may still be computationally feasible.
EDIT: Hardware based solutions are also ok.

10,How to mitigate SSL based DDoS attacks?,"
as you probably know the problem with SSL based DDoS attacks is, that the traffic cannot be analysed and filtered by a DDoS mitigation service provider such as Prolexic, Akamai, Radware, etc. without having the key to decrypt the traffic. 
I recently spoke with on of the above mentioned companies employees (Lets say company A) and they said that the only way is to use one of their products, wich is located in your network and its purpose is to deliver content via ssl and send all traffic in plaintext to the defense solution (same company, also internal network) which then in turn gives the filtered ""good traffic"" to your internal webservers.
Other companies have the approach that you handout your ssl key to them, so they can decrypt and analyze your traffic and pass the clean traffic on to your servers.
Company A stated, that the later is a absolute nogo and that it shouldn't even be considered. Problem is, their solution can only filter as much traffic as your infrastructure and their appliance can handle while cloud solutions have much higher capacities.
So the question is, is there another way of mitigating SSL based DDoS attacks, is handing out your ssl key really that bad and why?
I know that there already was a question on ""storing keys in the cloud - trusting the cloud provider vs. your own laptop, etc."" so I'm sorry if some of this is a duplicate, but the answers there didn't really answer my question.

12,Building a Security Training Simulation environment,"
My university is keen to build a security training simulation environment/platform and it will be a good learning experience for students. I Googled around to find out how it is built, but I only ended up with recommendations for a VirtualBox or VMWare lab environment been built using pwnOS, Metasploitable, etc...
What I'm looking for is to build an environment with a couple of vulnerable systems and network setup such that that students won't cross/interfere each other's work. For instance, the system could create a private simulation for each student to practice their class labs, I think some refer this as 'sandboxing'.
We are looking for something similar to Offensive Security training simulation or Hera Labs, another example is XNET from CERT, they have a very interesting training simulation for Forensics.
If you could give us some direction on how the system is actually built and if there any open source application that we could use to build the system, otherwise an organization who can build it for us (keep in mind this is university budget) we would really appreciate your kind input.
We are aware that Offensive Security offers this service but I need to get quotes from different vendors before can I proceed (at the end I prefer to build the system and might as well give it as project for the security lab students) 
We are also aware it may require a couple of servers and OSs to build it, and we do have unused hardware.
Thank you and Happy New Year

16,GPU powered Password cracking machine - buy metal or cloud?,"
As a IS consulting firm, we would like to have our very own password cracking machine.
Great.
Now, after some sketching and brain storming we concluded that GPU is the best way to go (contrary to CPU or rainbow tables).
And the questions that we found hard to tackle was what is the best choice - can we buy just enough power from on-demand cloud service (amazon's is an immediate selection but if you have any recommendations, go ahead) or to buy ourselves a machine and build it with the appropriate hardware.
btw, we are thinking on using oclHashcat-plus if it makes any difference.

17,Risks with Amazon S3 and costs,"
I have little security knowledge and looking at image hosting for a startup:

Say I have a 2MB document, is it possible for someone to send millions of requests to that get file?
From what I understand the costs for an end user requesting a file is:

Request Pricing:
GET and all other Requests †  $0.01 per 10,000 requests
Data Transfer Pricing:
Up to 10 TB / month   $0.120 per GB

Does that pricing mean this is a non-issue?
Does Amazon S3 have security measures in place to stop something like that happening?

Chinese police are forcing whole cities to install an Android spyware app Jingwang Weishi. They are stopping people in the street and detaining those who refuse to install it.
Knowing that I may be forced to install it sooner or later, what are my options to prepare against it?

20,Why don't websites and devices offer fake logins for hackers?,"
I was thinking about this earlier this morning and was wondering why websites and devices don't offer fake logins for hackers? What I mean by that is that if a hacker finds out some of your details and tries to log in to a website (for example) the website will show that you have successfully logged in but will show dummy data that is completely fake.
That way the hacker won't know if they have got the login details correct or not. It will also protect people in a security situation. For instance, imagine a criminal has stolen someones phone and realises he can't access it. He then points a gun at the owner who then types in part of their details correct but some of them incorrectly. The device unlocks in fake mode, and the criminal then thinks they have access and they decide not to shoot the person because they have complied with their wishes. But the criminal never knows that what they see is just a fake login.
Has anyone implemented something like this? It seems like quite a good idea to me.

I was playing an online game and I came in contact with this user. She was listed as from the same country as me (Egypt). So when she asked me for my cell phone number, I gave it to her. I figured it was to add me on WhatsApp so we can chat or something.
However, I instead received an SMS message (titled 'Telegram') with a number, and she asked me to tell her that number. I asked what it's for, she said that she's from Canada (not the country she listed on her avatar) and that she needs that code I received to connect with me, since I'm outside Canada.

28,Can simply decompressing a JPEG image trigger an exploit?,"
The novel Daemon is frequently praised for being realistic in its portrayal rather than just mashing buzzwords.
However, this struck me as unrealistic:

Gragg's e-mail contained a poisoned JPEG of the brokerage logo. JPEGs were compressed image files. When the user viewed the e-mail, the operating system ran a decompression algorithm to render the graphic on-screen; it was this decompression algorithm that executed Gragg's malicious script and let him slip inside the user's system—granting him full access. There was a patch available for the decompression flaw, but older, rich folks typically had no clue about security patches.

Is there such a thing? Is this description based on some real exploit?
This was published in December 2006.
Is it sensible to say ""the operating system"" was decompressing the image to render it? 

Note this has nothing to do with security of PHP image uploading scripts.  I'm asking about the decoding process of displaying a JPEG, not scripts taking input from remote users, nor files misnamed as .jpeg.  The duplicate flagging I'm responding to looks poor even for a buzzword match; really nothing alike other than mentioning image files.

Say my password is abc. I want to send it to the server over HTTP.
I could send it in plaintext and let the server hash it and compare it to the entries in its database, but then anyone that can see traffic over that connection would see the password in plain text.
So then I could hash it client-side and let the server just compare it without hashing since it's already hashed (or the server could even double hash, but no difference in this situation). But then again anyone that can see the traffic would see the password hashed, and then send the hashed password to the server and the server would accept it.
How do I send passwords over HTTP? Do I need to implement some encryption algorithm like RSA public key encryption? Or is this impossible?
The method should be usable in any browser.

29,"I detected someone probing my site for weaknesses, what can I do about it? [duplicate]","

My site has been getting probed by a bunch of IPs from Morroco (trying to submit forms, trying out potential URLs, trying to execute scripts etc..), I have a strong suspicion it's the same person after observing the pattern of how they behave. Looking at the logs they don't seem to have found any vulnerabilities. I'm not sure what I should do about this other than keep observing. Blocking the IP doesn't seem useful since it seems to change. 
Is there anything I can do about it at this point?

30,Is exposing the server time a security risk?,"
If I create a servlet that would return the server time publicly (no need for authentication), would this be a security issue? I couldn't think of any issue with this, but somehow something tells me I could be wrong.
To explain more, this end-point will be used by mobile apps to enhance their security (to avoid cheating by adjusting the device date).

31,How can I protect my website against bitsquatting?,"
I've just read an article about bitsquatting (which refers to the registration of a domain name one bit different than a popular domain) and I'm concerned about how it could allow an attacker to load its own assets on my website.
For example, if my website located at https://www.example.org/ loads a script file located at https://www.example.org/script.js, then an attacker could register dxample.org and host a malicious JS file, which would be downloaded and executed by some users of my website.
Is there any standard defense technique against it?

32,Is it more secure to program a client-server system in a language other than English?,"
I'm developing a system with communication via REST between front (JavaScript) and back end (Java/Spring) and this question popped up.
Does it makes this system more secure to name variables, URLs, etc in a language other than English?
I imagine it could because, since the most important programming languages are in English, it's likely most programmers know at least a bit of it. Naming our stuff in another language could make hacking more difficult because the attacker would have a harder time to understand what means and does what.
I couldn't find results on Google because ""programming"" an ""language"" together makes it impossible to find results about the other meaning of ""language"".

33,How safe is redirecting to another site?,"
Lets say I have a website at https://example.com/test. Whenever someone accesses this site, I want to just simply redirect them to https://example.com/Test.
Are there any possible vulnerabilities here? Or is this method safe since all I am doing is redirecting from one secured site to another?
