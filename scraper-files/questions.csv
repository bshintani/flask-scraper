1,How to keep Internet of Things projects secure? [closed],"
I want to experiment with the use of sensors for data logging and potentially for automated actions based on data properties. An example of the latter is if a value being monitored exceeds a threshold for X amount of intervals, some kind of notification or response is triggered, whether an LED lighting up or email being sent out.
I'm not an expert about sensors, networking, IoT, robotics, scripting, machine learning, or programming in general. That's all part of the learning process. I know enough to know security is important and easier to achieve if it's a goal from the beginning. So my question as I embark on this learning excursion is, what do I need to be aware of or control for to keep these systems safe as I create and experiment with them? If that question is so broad a book answers it, could you recommend a learning resource? Where does one start for learning how to keep home brewed IoT systems secure?
I realize this depends on two major things: security is harder as complexity increases; and security depends on threat models. Well, my simple sensor systems are bound to get more complex if I pursue more significant projects with them, thus the importance of good security that scales from the start. As for threat models, I don't anticipate enemies and these would all be relatively low-value and plentiful targets (many sensors monitoring basic things) but I do expect there are malicious agents seeking to control any processing power they can or disrupt systems just for the sake of chaos. Lastly as an importart part of the threat model is physical security, because if I put a sensor outside with a solar panel to power it, how do I stop mischievous kids or crooks from destroying or stealing the technology?

2,How safe are wifi enabled talking toys?,"
There have been ads on the radio recently for a wifi enabled toy called Talkies, which are advertised as being able to communicate with app enabled phones, with a ""trusted circle"" that other phones can be added to.
(Obligatory photo of a cute wifi enabled critter)

Especially considering the Krack vulnerability, and the known process of ""grooming"" a child that a sexual or other predator goes through to gain their trust and exploit them (Here is a story about how Snapchat was used), is this a toy that I should steer away from for my child?

4,Could IOT Botnets be Stopped by Static IP addressing the Devices?,"
I followed the recent IOT DDOS against Dyn and noticed that the attack seemed have three rounds of attack and mitigation. Since I'm not well versed in infosec I did some reasearch around DDOS mitigation techniques. From what I could tell it seems mitigation is essential heuristic traffic analysis to filter out humans from bots then IP banning.  Separately, I also noticed that in almost all the media had the same conclusion that IOT devices are insecure and can't/won't be patched for years. If these two assumptions are true, DDOS mitigation in its rawest since is IP filtering, and we are stuck with millions of infected IOT devices (and adding millions more devices that will one day likely be infected), wouldn't it make sense to start giving IOT devices a static IP, and then when it's detected as participating in a DDOS share the IP to others and block it?

5,How can I secure my security cameras?,"
I have dozens of cheap security cameras in my offices. I was under the assumption that, once I changed the admin password, disabled the insecure ""P2P Mode"", disabled UPNP, disabled guest access and changed default ports I was safe.
After the Mirai hack, I was shocked to see that my ""security"" camera it's accessible via telnet with root:xc3511.

Now, the telnet port shouldn't be forwarded outside by the router, but still it's a problem. What if some PC on the LAN gets infected by some malware?

6,Does the local network need to be hacked first for IoT devices to be accessible?,"
I completely understand how IoT devices were used in the massive DDoS attacks because they are easily manipulated due to lack of firewalls, default passwords, etc.
What I don't understand is although easily hacked, most IoT devices are connected to secured private wifi networks. 
Here's the question: So is it assumed that these thousands of IoT devices' networks were hacked first, then the device itself was hacked?

7,Cloud-based DDoS as a Service,"
With the consolidation of cloud computing and virtualization, a really simple doubt comes to my mind: why isn't DDoS being largely offered as a service? Why don't we see cloud-based DDoS attacks? 
vDOS, LizardStresser and others offered a way in which you could pay to attack a target but they used their own infrastructure. 
It seems safer and simpler to just charge a client, use part of that money to rent servers on an IaaS provider and build a cloud-based botnet. That way one could start an attack from inside the provider to a specific target without even using their own structure. This could even be used for spoofing of attacks in general. Is there any particular reason why this doesn't happen? 
I have no idea how difficult it is to build a botnet in either context (standard or cloud-based), if getting caught in the cloud would be easier or if this could just be a matter of profit.
Thanks in advance.

8,Can secrets be made safe in memory?,"
Say, I am running an application on a cloud server such as AWS. Suppose I supply a key at run-time (so its not stored anywhere alongside/inside code), is there a way to secure this key in memory?
So if an attacker gets access to the remote server at a later time, he still should not be able to extract the key from memory. Are there any ways to achieve this? Or is it known to be theoretically impossible?
The technique discussed here, transparent runtime security, is claimed to make it ""difficult"", but it may still be computationally feasible.
EDIT: Hardware based solutions are also ok.

10,How to mitigate SSL based DDoS attacks?,"
as you probably know the problem with SSL based DDoS attacks is, that the traffic cannot be analysed and filtered by a DDoS mitigation service provider such as Prolexic, Akamai, Radware, etc. without having the key to decrypt the traffic. 
I recently spoke with on of the above mentioned companies employees (Lets say company A) and they said that the only way is to use one of their products, wich is located in your network and its purpose is to deliver content via ssl and send all traffic in plaintext to the defense solution (same company, also internal network) which then in turn gives the filtered ""good traffic"" to your internal webservers.
Other companies have the approach that you handout your ssl key to them, so they can decrypt and analyze your traffic and pass the clean traffic on to your servers.
Company A stated, that the later is a absolute nogo and that it shouldn't even be considered. Problem is, their solution can only filter as much traffic as your infrastructure and their appliance can handle while cloud solutions have much higher capacities.
So the question is, is there another way of mitigating SSL based DDoS attacks, is handing out your ssl key really that bad and why?
I know that there already was a question on ""storing keys in the cloud - trusting the cloud provider vs. your own laptop, etc."" so I'm sorry if some of this is a duplicate, but the answers there didn't really answer my question.

12,Building a Security Training Simulation environment,"
My university is keen to build a security training simulation environment/platform and it will be a good learning experience for students. I Googled around to find out how it is built, but I only ended up with recommendations for a VirtualBox or VMWare lab environment been built using pwnOS, Metasploitable, etc...
What I'm looking for is to build an environment with a couple of vulnerable systems and network setup such that that students won't cross/interfere each other's work. For instance, the system could create a private simulation for each student to practice their class labs, I think some refer this as 'sandboxing'.
We are looking for something similar to Offensive Security training simulation or Hera Labs, another example is XNET from CERT, they have a very interesting training simulation for Forensics.
If you could give us some direction on how the system is actually built and if there any open source application that we could use to build the system, otherwise an organization who can build it for us (keep in mind this is university budget) we would really appreciate your kind input.
We are aware that Offensive Security offers this service but I need to get quotes from different vendors before can I proceed (at the end I prefer to build the system and might as well give it as project for the security lab students) 
We are also aware it may require a couple of servers and OSs to build it, and we do have unused hardware.
Thank you and Happy New Year

16,GPU powered Password cracking machine - buy metal or cloud?,"
As a IS consulting firm, we would like to have our very own password cracking machine.
Great.
Now, after some sketching and brain storming we concluded that GPU is the best way to go (contrary to CPU or rainbow tables).
And the questions that we found hard to tackle was what is the best choice - can we buy just enough power from on-demand cloud service (amazon's is an immediate selection but if you have any recommendations, go ahead) or to buy ourselves a machine and build it with the appropriate hardware.
btw, we are thinking on using oclHashcat-plus if it makes any difference.

17,Risks with Amazon S3 and costs,"
I have little security knowledge and looking at image hosting for a startup:

Say I have a 2MB document, is it possible for someone to send millions of requests to that get file?
From what I understand the costs for an end user requesting a file is:

Request Pricing:
GET and all other Requests †  $0.01 per 10,000 requests
Data Transfer Pricing:
Up to 10 TB / month   $0.120 per GB

Does that pricing mean this is a non-issue?
Does Amazon S3 have security measures in place to stop something like that happening?

Chinese police are forcing whole cities to install an Android spyware app Jingwang Weishi. They are stopping people in the street and detaining those who refuse to install it.
Knowing that I may be forced to install it sooner or later, what are my options to prepare against it?

20,Why don't websites and devices offer fake logins for hackers?,"
I was thinking about this earlier this morning and was wondering why websites and devices don't offer fake logins for hackers? What I mean by that is that if a hacker finds out some of your details and tries to log in to a website (for example) the website will show that you have successfully logged in but will show dummy data that is completely fake.
That way the hacker won't know if they have got the login details correct or not. It will also protect people in a security situation. For instance, imagine a criminal has stolen someones phone and realises he can't access it. He then points a gun at the owner who then types in part of their details correct but some of them incorrectly. The device unlocks in fake mode, and the criminal then thinks they have access and they decide not to shoot the person because they have complied with their wishes. But the criminal never knows that what they see is just a fake login.
Has anyone implemented something like this? It seems like quite a good idea to me.

I was playing an online game and I came in contact with this user. She was listed as from the same country as me (Egypt). So when she asked me for my cell phone number, I gave it to her. I figured it was to add me on WhatsApp so we can chat or something.
However, I instead received an SMS message (titled 'Telegram') with a number, and she asked me to tell her that number.

29,Can simply decompressing a JPEG image trigger an exploit?,"
The novel Daemon is frequently praised for being realistic in its portrayal rather than just mashing buzzwords.
However, this struck me as unrealistic:

Gragg's e-mail contained a poisoned JPEG of the brokerage logo. JPEGs were compressed image files. When the user viewed the e-mail, the operating system ran a decompression algorithm to render the graphic on-screen; it was this decompression algorithm that executed Gragg's malicious script and let him slip inside the user's system—granting him full access. There was a patch available for the decompression flaw, but older, rich folks typically had no clue about security patches.

Is there such a thing? Is this description based on some real exploit?
This was published in December 2006.
Is it sensible to say ""the operating system"" was decompressing the image to render it? 

Note this has nothing to do with security of PHP image uploading scripts.  I'm asking about the decoding process of displaying a JPEG, not scripts taking input from remote users, nor files misnamed as .jpeg.  The duplicate flagging I'm responding to looks poor even for a buzzword match; really nothing alike other than mentioning image files.

Say my password is abc. I want to send it to the server over HTTP.
I could send it in plaintext and let the server hash it and compare it to the entries in its database, but then anyone that can see traffic over that connection would see the password in plain text.
So then I could hash it client-side and let the server just compare it without hashing since it's already hashed (or the server could even double hash, but no difference in this situation). But then again anyone that can see the traffic would see the password hashed, and then send the hashed password to the server and the server would accept it.
How do I send passwords over HTTP? Do I need to implement some encryption algorithm like RSA public key encryption? Or is this impossible?
The method should be usable in any browser.

40,Should I let my child's school have access to my kid's personal laptop?,"
My kid is starting 6th grade and the school requires him to get a laptop and bring it to school. Now the school IT department wants to install some software on the laptop and is asking for administrative access. They want to install Office, Outlook, an AV and some site certificates. 
I feel that on principle this is not right, as it's not the school's device, so school staff shouldn't have access. Additionally, I don't have any sense of how good the school's security practices are. What if they inadvertently install malware? However, if I refuse then I risk being ""that parent"" and I'm setting myself up for a few years of headaches as any time the school wants to add new software, I'll have to do it myself. 
What would you do? 

Update
Wow, this certainly blew up! Thanks to everyone for reading and commenting.
We ended up letting the school have access, for a couple reasons:

The clock was ticking and our child was the only one whose laptop
wasn't set up, so he wasn't able to fully participate in lessons and
was missing out on emails sent to the students.
I'm traveling and am not at home, so remotely installing the software myself   would add another layer of complexity and require someone at home to prep the laptop for remote admin, while adding more delay to the device being ready.

It came down to what's best for the child and at the moment it seemed to us parents that it was letting the school have its way. I can check the device myself later and if there is anything that compromises the device's security or the child's privacy, then I have a better argument against the school's approach. In the meantime I'm letting them know that they could have communicated more about their plans and given us time to have a conversation about it rather than springing it on us at the last minute (though from their point-of-view this worked out just fine).

41,Is a standalone phone number considered Personally Identifiable Information?,"
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is defined (the example below is from NIST) as (emphasis mine)

Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's
  identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records,
  etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying
  information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such
  as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.

How should this be interpreted in the case of a single phone number, not associated to a name?
In other words, if an application is sending bare phone numbers to a server (I am looking at you WhatsApp) without the name of the number owner, is that number still PII?

EDIT: Jonah Benton gave in his answer a very nice summary of the question, I quote him for the sake of clarity

(...) the question refers to a practice where an app on a user's phone
  gets access to contacts (...) on the phone and uploads all
  phone numbers to the server without also uploading the names
  associated with those numbers (despite having access to them.)
Are these uploaded bare numbers, without names, considered PII?

42,Privacy Policy(ies). Does the cookie “collect” browser data or “request” browser data? [closed],"
I'm working on legal portion of my site, Privacy Policy in particular. I've done the research and found that nearly all the answers to my question (below), is generalized.
Question: Do cookies ""collect"" data from user browsers, or do cookies ""request"" then receive data from user browsers?
This seems to be a very important distinction. Do I put into my privacy policy that my site ""collects"" data from my users or do I ""request"" data from my users.
My understanding of the core functionality is that cookies request data of user browser or browser activity. Users control how their browser will respond (or handle cookies) in their browser settings. If users have the ultimate control of handling ""responses"" to cookies is it proper for website privacy policies to state that they use cookies to collect browser data? Isn't it more accurate to state something like: ""We use cookies to request data from your browser. Depending on you have your settings, your response to our request my impact your experience."" Or something along those lines.
For years the way I understood the phrase ""cookies collect browser data"" is that we (websites) force code (the cookie), onto your browser that opens a siv for all your activity to flow back to us. But this isn't the case at all. Cookies actually make a ""request"" (i.e., asks) for the user's permission first, and depending on how the user has set up their browser settings, the cookie request is honored or denied.
I'm trying to stay away from the term ""collect"" as a general matter. I think it's improperly used and leaves the wrong impression on users.
Has anyone else thought about this? Am I missing something?
UPDATE: Thank you for all the good responses below. I've concluded that my Privacy Policy will NOT state ""We use cookies to collect info...,"" but rather: ""We use cookies to request info..."" because the former implies no consent required, whereas the latter implies consent required, and IS the more accurate case.

43,Find IM user location via netstat?,"

Going through the ""article"" there is not a lot of details given. And I thought I would try it out. 
It basically stated that it was possible to find out the location of a Facebook user that sent you a Facebook message. Specifically, by looking at the IP addresses that appear in the ""Foreign Address"" column of Netstat. To find the geo-location one has to copy the last added IP address from the list into a IP address lookup tool like http://whatismyipaddress.com/. Then copy the coordinates and use google maps to find the exact location of the person. 
After some time getting the preferred Netstat arguments and some filtering with awk netstat -ntpw | awk '{print $5}'. The  GEO locations the IP addresses hold are mostly in America some in Ireland and some in the Netherlands. When I enter the coordinates in google maps I get unknown locations. 
This is just fake, right? Or did it used to work like this? If so, that would seem very concerning.

47,What makes Docker more secure than VMs or bare metal?,"
I recently had a discussion with a Docker expert about the security of Docker vs. virtual machines. When I told that I've read from different sources that it's easier for code running within a Docker container to escape from it than for a code running in a virtual machine, the expert explained that I'm completely wrong, and that Docker machines are actually more secure in terms of preventing the malicious code from affecting other machines, compared to virtual machines or bare metal.
Although he tried to explain what makes Docker containers more secure, his explanation was too technical for me.
From what I understand, “OS-level virtualization reuses the kernel-space between virtual machines” as explained in a different answer on this site. In other words, code from a Docker container could exploit a kernel vulnerability, which wouldn't be possible to do from a virtual machine.
Therefore, what could make it inherently more secure to use Docker compared to VMs or bare metal isolation, in a context where code running in a container/machine would intentionally try to escape and infect/damage other containers/machines? Let's assume Docker is configured properly, which prevents three of the four categories of attacks described here.

50,"Company computers for competent developers, how can you deal with them?","
This is a follow up on Is there a legitimate reason I should be required to use my company’s computer.  Mostly, because I see a huge issue in a couple of specific situations.
Had I been in a position of the security engineer for an organization I would definitely put a policy that only company computers shall be used.  That does make sense, and protects not only company data but the liability of employees.
Yet, there is one case in which such a policy bugs me:  A competent developer (I'm not talking about a junior developer, I'm talking about a middle to senior level developer) will potentially have on his work machine:

17 database engines;
20 docker containers;
10 test virtual machines (let's say using something like qemu).

That is a very common scenario in startups and post-startups (a startup that managed to survive several years).  Moreover, this developer will be changing his docker containers and virtual machines every week, since he will probably be testing new technology.
Requiring this developer to refer to the security engineer to install new software every time is completely impractical.  Moreover, since a company would have more than one such developer, going with the typical company managed computers for everyone involves drawbacks:

Maintaining the computers of, say, six such developers is a full time job for a competent security engineer.
The manager of those developers will be terribly angry because what his team is doing for 50% of their work-time is to wait for the security engineer.

On the other hand allowing the developers to use the machines freely is dangerous: one rogue docker container or virtual machine and you have an insider.  I would even say that these developer's computers are more dangerous than that of a common user (say, a manager with spreadsheet software).

How do you make sensible policies for competent developers?
Here are some other solutions I could think of (or saw in the past), most of which were pretty bad:

Disallow internet access from the development machines:

You need internet access to read documentation;
You need to access repositories, often found on the internet.

Give developers two computers, one for internet and one for development machines:

Complaints about lost productivity: typing Alt+2 to get the browser is faster than switching to another computer;
Repository access is cumbersome: download in one place, copy to the other.
Encourages the developer to circumvent the security and make a USB-based connection between both machines, so he can work from a single computer (saw it happening more than once).

Move development to the servers (i.e. not development on desk machines):

This is just moving the same problem deeper, now the rogue container is on the server;
Arguably worse than allowing the developer to do what he pleases on his own machine.


There must be a better way.

I could also use SOAP instead, so that the call to the web service is a bit more complicated. But, I still don't know if this gives me any real advantage over RESTful based service.
I was thinking about hardcoding the key into my client app, so that only my client app could use the service. Also, maybe some code obfuscation may help. But, how much does this really help?
UPDATE: As JOW pointed out Fiddler
could be used to decrypt https and see the full request. However, if I use Android app only, this may be solved by hardcoding server certificate in Android client app. And also, there is SOAP WS-Security, but I guess a tool can be made to function in similar way as fidler to circumvent that.

55,Returning the wrong HTTP response code on purpose?,"
I'm writing a simple REST API, and I want to restrict access to my mobile-client only. In other words, I'm trying to prevent a malicious user from e.g. using curl to make an unauthorized POST request.
Of course, this is impossible. However, there are certain countermeasures that make it difficult for a hacker to succeed. Right now, I am encrypting all requests with a private key, stored client-side (obviously, this is not ideal, but the difficulty in reverse-engineering an iOS app will hopefully deter all but the most determined hackers).
One simple idea I had is to return the wrong HTTP response code for an unauthorized request. Rather than return a ""401 Unauthorized,"" why not return e.g. ""305 Use Proxy,"" i.e. purposely being confusing. Has anyone ever thought about doing this?

56,Ensure web service only accessed by authorized applications,"
Preface
My mobile app allows users to create accounts on my service. In addition to being able to log in with external authentication providers, like Facebook, I want to give the user the option to create an account using an e-mail address.
Normally, all calls to my web service are authenticated via basic authentication over HTTPS. However, the create account function (also over HTTPS) does not have any authentication - since the user does not yet have any credentials.
If I was writing a website, I would use Captcha to stop my database from being filled up with bogus accounts via script.
Question
How can I verify that new user requests are coming from an instance of my application and not from a bot?
If all data is sent over HTTPS, is it sufficient for the application to have a stored password to say ""hey, it's me!""? What are the best practices for doing something like this?
Elaboration
The server is written in Java using the Spring Framework and Spring Security. It is hosted on App Engine. Cost is a concern (both network and computation). The app is a mobile game. I do not store sensitive information like credit card numbers. However, I do keep track of user purchases on the Apple and Android stores. My biggest concern is player experience. I don't want a hacker bringing down the system and ruining someone's enjoyment of the game. I also, need to make sure that the player faces as few obstacles as possible when creating an account.
Update/Clarification
I am looking for a way to ensure all calls to the service are coming from an instance of my application. User accounts are already protected because the stateless service requires that they send their credentials on every request. There are no sessions and no cookies.
I need to stop bot-spam on the unsecured calls, such as create-new-account. I cannot use captcha because it does not fit into the flow of the application.
